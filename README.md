# Sinhala to English and English to Sinhala Translator (SEES)

This repository contains the codebase and documentation for a rule-based machine translation system, SEES, capable of translating sentences between Sinhala and English.

## Abstract

SEES is a rule-based machine translation system that facilitates translation between Sinhala and English languages bidirectionally. It includes features like Sinhalese font translation to English characters and English grammar and spell checking (Singlish). The system aims to provide smooth and meaningful translations of words and sentences.

## Keywords
Sinhala to English Translator, English to Sinhala Translator, English, Singlish, Sinhala, Rule-based machine translation.

## Introduction

The system addresses the challenges of translating between non-similar languages like Sinhala and English. It leverages rule-based translation techniques and tokenization to achieve accurate translations. SEES comprises a Sinhala to English translator, an English to Sinhala translator, and features for handling Singlish and Sinhalese fonts.

## Methodology

SEES utilizes a rule-based engine for translation, tokenization, and syntax checking. It employs natural language processing techniques and integrates with external APIs like Google Translate and gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) for enhanced functionality. The system also implements language detection mechanisms and text summarization using NLTK and TextRank algorithms.

## Results

The system achieves a high accuracy rate in translating sentences between Sinhala and English. It handles various sentence structures, verb tenses, and grammatical forms effectively. However, challenges remain in dealing with word ambiguities, which require human intervention for accurate translations.

## Conclusion

SEES represents a significant step towards bidirectional translation between Sinhala and English languages. Future work involves improving word ambiguity handling and expanding the knowledge base for better translations.
